# Project Showcase

This document outlines what the project showcase page will show and provides a rough idea of what it will look like.

## Content

The project showcase page should show the following:

- Images of the project
- Motivation behind
- Description
- Technologies stack
- Current features

## Design

- The images should be the main focus of the page, make them large
- There should be an explicit button to visit the project's source code (or website)
- The carousel should provide a slick animated transition

## Notes

- I need to organize the project items based on the images
  - Which projects have the most eye-catching images?
