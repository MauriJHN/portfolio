        <p>
          I'm a software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions and solving complex problems.
          Before I started my career in computer science, I was already significantly intrigued by the power of
          computers.
          It all started with a desire to learn Java in order to create Minecraft mods. I was actually introduced to my
          first
          programming language in-game. Although the goal of creating mods was never reached, it was immediately clear
          to me
          that this was the path I wanted to take. Since then, I have continued to learn and grow as a developer, and I
          am excited
          to continue my journey in this ever evolving field.
          <br><br>
          Having already worked in 3 major corporations in a variety of professional roles, I am well-versed in a wide
          range of
          programming languages and frameworks. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow and
          learn and always
          strive to put quality into my work by following the latest trends and best practices.
          <br><br>
          Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
